# TODO
## December 8
- Add documentation files (as .md files), move the description of the data that is currently in LaTeX to these markdown files (the formatting in LaTeX can be done at a later stage).
- Check if home win pct changes a lot by season compared to overall.  Create line graph showing season-by-season home win percentages for all 4 leagues combined.
- General comment on line graphs with multiple lines (e.g., NFL, NBA,MLB, NHL): In addition to using colors to distinguish the lines, also use different shapes for the data points (e.g., disk, square, star, ...).
