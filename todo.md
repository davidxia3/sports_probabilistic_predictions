# TODO
## December 8
- Add documentation files (as .md files), move the description of the data that is currently in LaTeX to these markdown files (the formatting in LaTeX can be done at a later stage).
- Check if home win pct changes a lot by season compared to overall.  Create line graph showing season-by-season home win percentages for all 4 leagues combined.
